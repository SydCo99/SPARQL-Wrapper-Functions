# SPARQL-Wrapper-Functions
This repository contains basic SPARQL queries written in Python using the SPARQL Wrapper library. It is intended to provide ontologists an easy way to run SPARQL queries on their own computers, and provide a series of well written SPARQL query functions that can query any ontology. 

Most of the functions have been adapted from the He Group example SRPAQL queries, available [here](https://ontobee.org/sparql).

Some functions have been adapted from the EDAM Ontolog caseologue GitHub, available [here](https://github.com/edamontology/caseologue.git). 

## Navigating this Repository
All the SPARQL query functions are compiled together in the "all_functions.py" file. 

Each individual function has its own ipynb file, where there are markdown comments in the code available to help you better tailor the preset queries to your ontology. 

The "AllFunctionsExample.ipynb" file is an example of how you can import and use individual functions from the all_functions.py file.
