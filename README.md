# SPARQL-Wrapper-Functions
This is an early stage directory containing basic SPARQL queries written in Python using the SPARQL Wrapper library. It is intended to provide ontologists an easy way to run SPARQL queries on their own computers, and provide a series of well written SPARQL query functions that can query any ontology.
